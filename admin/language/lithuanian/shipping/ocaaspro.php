If you follow the steps below you will be a shipping rate master in no time!</p><h4>Tooltips & Examples</h4><p>Every field is complete with a pop-up tooltip that explains how that field works. For some of the more complex fields, click the <i class="fa fa-info-circle" style="color: #3299BB;"> </i> icon to get a more in-depth description as well as examples of how the field works and the types of settings to use.</p><h4>Setting up Shipping Rates Step-By-Step</h4><ol><li>Give the shipping rate a description. Only visible to the administrator, the Rate Description is used to help you identify the rate amongst the shipping rates list.</li><li>Assign a Shipping Image, Shipping Name and Shipping Description for the shipping rate. This is the shipping name that the customer will see when getting a shipping estimate and while checking out</li><li>Assign a Sort Order value.  This will determine the order that the shipping rate will appear in the shipping rates list in the administrator panel, as well as when sorting the shipping rates by sort order.</il><li>Select a Tax Class that applies to this shipping rate. This will charge taxes on the total shipping cost.</li><li>Shipping rates can be setup to only be available on certain Days Of The Week, between specific Time, and between specific Dates. This allows you to setup shipping rates such as "Next Day Delivery" for Monday - Thursday, but not Friday - Sunday. Likewise, you can have "Next Day Delivery" only available to customers between the hours of 10:00 and 22:00. You can also use the Dates fields to setup shipping specials for specific dates or date range.</li><li>Select the Stores and Customer Groups that the shipping rate applies to. This allows you to set unique rates per store, or for specific customer groups.</li><li>Select the Geo Zones that this shipping rate will apply to. This will determine what locations in the world this shipping rate is valid for. You can also select "All Other Zones" which will assign the shipping rate to any area in the world that is not covered by a geo zone.</li><li>Further define the areas that this shipping rate applies to by setting up Postal Code Ranges. Setting postal code ranges along with Geo Zones allows you to set rates for specific areas within a zone.<li>Select the postal code format. Due to the unique formatting of UK postal codes there is a separate script to verify and compare these postal codes. For this reason, you must use the full postal code value in the postal code ranges field (e.g. A11A1A:Z999Z9Z).</li><li>In the Postal Code Ranges, select whether to allow or deny the specified postal code ranges. If a customer inputs a postal code that falls within your specified ranges, the system will either enable the shipping rate if the specified postal codes are set to allow, or disable the shipping rate if the specified postal codes are set to deny.</li><li>Define the Postal Code Ranges. The postal code ranges use a from:to format (e.g. 901:902).</li></li><li>Assigning Cart Requirements is useful if you want the shipping rate to only appear after a certain cart parameter is met. A great example of this is "Free Shipping" after the cart reaches $150.00. To accomplish this, set the Total > Max field to 149.99 for all shipping rates to be replaced by free shipping, then set the Total > Min field to 150.00 for the free shipping rate. This same functionality also applies to the Product Dimensions fields.</li><li>Select which Categories the shipping rate applies to. Selecting the right Category Settings is important when limiting the shipping rate to specific product categories. Refer to the <i class="fa fa-info-circle" style="color: #3299BB;"> </i> icon for a detailed description of how to use these fields.</li><li>Choose whether to combine this shipping rate to other shipping rates.  Refer to the <i class="fa fa-info-circle" style="color: #3299BB;"> </i> icon for a detailed description of how to use these fields.</li><li>Select the Total Type to be used in the shipping calculation. This will determine what total type is used when using Total-Based shipping and when using percentage based shipping rates. The "Total" is the running total of the cart and is influenced by the sort order of the Shipping order total extension. "Sub-Total" refer to the sub-total of the cart before any taxes, coupons, discounts & fees. "Sub-Total with Tax" is the total of the products including taxes before any coupons, discounts & fees.</li><li>Rate Settings determine how the parameters used for the shipping cost calculation.  Refer to the <i class="fa fa-info-circle" style="color: #3299BB;"> </i> icon for a detailed description of how to use these fields.</li><li>Shipping Rates is where you assign the shipping cost.  Refer to the <i class="fa fa-info-circle" style="color: #3299BB;"> </i> icon for a detailed description of how to use these fields.</li><li>Define a min / max shipping cost in Shipping Cost Adjustments. If the calculated shipping cost is less than the minimum shipping cost, the system will automatically increase the shipping cost to meet the minimum. This same function also reduces the shipping cost to meet the max shipping cost field if the calculated shipping cost is greater than the max shipping cost. Assigning a value to the Add field acts as a handling fee and will apply either a flat rate or percentage based fee to the shipping cost. When assigning a percentage based handling fee, the handling fee will be a percentage of the total shipping cost.</li><li>The last step is to apply a Handling Fee / Fuel Surcharge to the total shipping cost. This is the total cost of the shipping after the Shipping Cost Adjustments. The Handling Fee / Fuel Surcharge can be either a flat cost or percentage based. When assigning a percentage based value, the Handling Fee / Fuel Surcharge will be a percentage of the total shipping cost after the Shipping Cost Adjustments.</li></ol></p>';
